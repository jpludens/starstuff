Goal: Implement remaining abilities
   Blob Destroyer
        requires multiple pending effects
        I refuse to treat them as ordered at any point in the code whatsoever
        card.abilities will map triggers to /lists/
        values will be a tuple so that initializing cards doesn't require creating a bunch of ValueEffects
        probably just create ChoiceEffect at the card declaration instead of in trigger_abilities
        blob destroyers will be a list of effects instead of a single effect

   Stealth Needle
         Target move
   Blob Carrier
   Fleet HQ
          introduce a check that examines all moves for Actions.Play with a card with CardType.SHIP
          effect needs to end when base leaves play
          add a "source" field to effects
   Freighter / Central Office
        count available topdecks
        "topdeck" is like buy ... but topdecks. both reduce tracked topdeck counts
   Embassy Yacht
          Conditionality
   Blob World
         gamestate needs to keep an examinable log of turn actions to be searched for Actions.PLAY/Factions.BLOB

Goal: Use a Strategy class to trigger deterministic abilities
Goal: use a Strategy class to mimic app

Goal: Create a data visualisation scheme for displaying an entire game's log of moves
      (eg, cards bought each round, additional cards drawn, damage done, etc)
Goal: Create a data analysis scheme for analyzing decks (and trade row favorablity)
      (eg, x combat guaranteed y combat possible per cycle; velocity (turns/cycle))
Goal: Create a data visualation scheme for deck progress throughout a game
      (eg, graph combat and trade potential over time)

Goal: Create a web interface for designing strategies
